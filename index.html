            <p>Getting a beautiful bouquet of color each week is such a treat and always brightens our day having them in the office. People always comment on how gorgeous they are and each week is so different and unique, it's always a fun surprise. You might not know how much fresh flowers can improve your mood, until you do, then you simply can't live 
                without them!</p>
            <span>Morgan, BLOC Co-Working Spaces</span>
            <p>I was first introduced to the joy of getting a Native Poppy delivery every month from my daughter. After a year of lovely arrangements arriving at my door I added a second monthly delivery. I have so enjoyed the beautiful, surprising, elegant arrangements that arrive every other week. They are always beautiful, fresh and vibrant and include a lovely mix of unusual and classic blossoms. Whenever I want a flower delivery for friends or loved ones, I can always count on Native Poppy to deliver their particular brand of 
                love and joy.</p>
            <span>Ariane</span>
            <p>The Native Poppy flower subscription was the perfect gift for my Mother-In-Law! Native Poppy’s bouquets are always so fresh and beautiful and she loves receiving them right to her door each month. The Native Poppy staff have been incredibly helpful and have assisted us with rescheduling a couple of her subscription deliveries when she was out of town. I can’t recommend them enough and will definitely be gifting more flower subscriptions 
                in the future!</p>

            <h3> <strong> FAQ</strong> </h3>
            <span>Q: Is there a minimum commitment required to sign up for a subscription?</span>
            <p>A: Nope! We ask that you try it for a few weeks/months and if you don't love it, you can cancel!</p>
            <span>Q:​ Am I able to set up a subscription as a gift?</span>
            <p>A:​ Yes! Subscriptions make awesome gifts! You can set one up for delivery so the recipient receives their flowers right to their door, or for pick up if you know they are already a regular and pop in frequently.</p>
            <span>Q:​ Can I change my selected day of the week?</span>
            <p>A: ​Yes! A rescheduling email must be sent to hello@nativepoppy.com 72 hours before your next charge date. *Please note, scheduling changes are accommodated infrequently. Changes every week are not permitted.</p>
            <span>Q: Can I change mi color palette</span>
            <p>A:​ Yes! A color palette request email must be sent to hello@nativepoppy.com 72 hours before your next charge date.</p>
            <span>Q:​ If my subscription is set as a pick up, can I pick up at either shop location?</span>
            <p>A:​ No, you will have a home shop where you pick up each time. *Your order can occasionally be relocated with 72 hours notice.</p>
            <span>Q:​ What happens if I miss my subscription pick up?</span>
            <p>A:​ We notify you by phone of a missed pick up and will hold your flowers in our flower fridge for 48 hours. After 48 hours, your order will be forfeited.</p>
            <span>Q:​ What happens if I miss my subscription delivery?</span>
            <p>A:​ You or the recipient does not need to be home to receive your flowers. If no one answers, your flowers will be left in a safe, shaded area. A delivery driver will call if we are unable to safely deliver your flowers. If we are unable to deliver your flowers, they will be returned to our shop. You then have the option to pick them up or pay for a redelivery.</p>
            <span>Q: How do I cancel my subscription?</span>
            <p>A: ​A cancellation email must be sent to hello@nativepoppy.com 72 hours before your next charge date.</p>
